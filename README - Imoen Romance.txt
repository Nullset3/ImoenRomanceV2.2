1.	*** INSTALLATION ***

You will need Throne of Bhaal to play this mod.


You should note that the mod comes is ZIP format. Most versions of windows should be able to extract the file.
Winzip can be used if you need to extract the files another way: http://www.winzip.com/win/en/prod_down.html


Although I might be insulting your intelligence, fellow player, here are the installation instructions:

1) Place the zip file in your root Baldur's Gate 2 directory (where baldur.exe is), right click and select Extract Here. Then move the zip file to another location.

2) Open your Baldur's Gate 2 folder, and double-click 'setup-imoenRomance.exe'. If there is no setup-imoenRomance.exe in this directory, you have extracted it to the wrong place.

3) Wait for it to install everything, and press enter when it is asked so it will unpack some additional files.

And that's it... you can play the mod now.

If you want to uninstall the mod, just double-click again 'setup-imoenRomance.exe'



---------------------------------------------------------



2.	*** COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ***

This mod should be compatible with any and all WeiDU mod out there. 

There seem to be problems with BGT and the Imoen dream sequences. I can't claim compatibility at the moment.



----------------------------------------------------------



3.	*** THINGS TO EXPECT IN THIS MOD ***

Baldur's Gate II SPOILERS AHEAD!

- Imoen and the main character are Bhaalspawn brother and sister / sisters. There's a bit of an "ick" factor there, and the mod deals with it head on.

- Imoen will romance any PC, regardless of gender or race. This is segregation of plot and gameplay. All of her dialogue is tailored to normal-height characters, and no references are made to ugly-faced, smelly half-orcs or stocky, burly dwarves with knee-long beards.

- It is HIGHLY recommended that you start a new game to fully experience the romance. You don't need to do this to experiment at least half of the interactions, but if you want her to love you, you'll have to start from the beginning.

- Imoen wants to be treated nicely. Evil characters may romance her, but they must be a little more careful than others.

- Getting all the answers right so that Imoen falls in love with her Bhaalspawn sibling is tricky. However, having a healthy relationship with your sister isn't all that hard. There is quite a bit of content in the mod that has nothing to do with romance and may be enjoyed by any PC.

- There is some mild bad language sprinkled here and there.

- Things get rather steamy when spending quality time with Imoen.

- A wide variety of dialogue choices was one of the priorities when writing this mod. Some of these options are a little crazy, some of these options are cruel, and some are flat out depraved.

- Don't just wait for Imoen to start talking to you. Sometimes you have to initiate the conversation; to do this, click the "talk to" icon down there by the weapons, and click on Imoen.

- The music is homemade with terribly primitive instruments. Do forgive if you don't like, and just appreciate the thought!

4.	*** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ***

Dreams are important. They tell us things that we can't figure out with our conscious minds. Rest often, it's good for you.
