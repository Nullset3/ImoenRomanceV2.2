	*** *** *** Imoen's Romance Mod, Version 1.202 *** *** ***
	__________________________________________________________

______________________

This version is: 1.202
______________________

The mod is being stealth-edited for better quality writing. All dialogues are the same; only the lines themselves are being fixed.

560 lines done out of ~6000.







PLEASE NOTE:
This mod has content only for Shadows of Amn. Throne of Bhaal content is currently under development.


__________________________________________________________________________


Credit where it's due:

Salvanas - Imoen dialogue: the Kelsey Romance mod, by Jason Compton and Jesse Meyers, includes Imoen's response to Salvanas' affections. I have added some romance-sensitive responses to this dialogue. Kelsey was such a permanent addition to my mod list that at first I thought this dialogue was part of the vanilla game, and so I went on to add romanced responses like nobody's business. Needless to say, this was rather rude! It was quite embarrassing to find out I had in fact stolen content from another mod. Oooooooops. Luckily, everything was sorted out and there is now general happiness.

Eternal Imoen: Long departed modder extraordinaire Hlidskialf included this feature. Many thanks!

1.	*** INSTALLATION ***



You will need Throne of Bhaal to play this mod.


You should note that the mod comes is RAR format. You will need WinRar or any other rar-compatible decompression software. 
Winrar can be aquired in http://www.rarlabs.com



Although I might be insulting your intelligence, fellow player, here are the installation instructions:

1) The file is a .rar package; just double-click it and tell it to decompress everything in your Baldur's Gate II root folder. Make sure you extract all subfolders, an option that should be checked by default on any extractor you are using.

2) Open your BGII folder, and double-click 'Setup-Imoen.exe'. If there is no Setup-Imoen.exe in this directory, you have extracted it to the wrong place.

3) Wait for it to install everything, and press enter when it is asked so it will unpack some additional files.

And that's it... you can play the mod now.

If you want to uninstall the mod, just double-click again 'Setup-Imoen.exe'



_________________________________________________________




2.	*** COMPATIBILITY ISSUES ***

This mod should be compatible with any and all WeiDU mod out there. 

Of special mention is the popular Dungeon-Be-Gone mod, as there is a small amount of new content for Irenicus' Dungeon:

If it's the first time you play Imoen's romance I'd recommend that you didn't use DBG so you can get everything normally. If you've played more than once, feel free to use it... if you do, you will only be missing the little comment from Imoen about Khalid if Jaheira isn't in party. When you are taken to the exit by Jasper, wait a little until the first dialogue triggers; after having that, walk some steps away from the exit and the second should trigger too. It has been tested countless times, so there shouldn't be any problem.

Also, there seem to be problems with BGT and the Imoen dream sequences. I can't claim compatibility at the moment.


	__________________________________________________________


3.	*** THINGS TO EXPECT IN THIS MOD ***

Baldur's Gate II SPOILERS AHEAD!

- Imoen and the main character are Bhaalspawn brother and sister / sisters. There's a bit of an "ick" factor there, and the mod deals with it head on.

- Imoen will romance any PC, regardless of gender or race. This is segregation of plot and gameplay. All of her dialogue is tailored to normal-height characters, and no references are made to ugly-faced, smelly half-orcs or stocky, burly dwarves with knee-long beards.

- It is HIGHLY recommended that you start a new game to fully experience the romance. You don't need to do this to experiment at least half of the interactions, but if you want her to love you, you'll have to start from the beginning.

- Imoen wants to be treated nicely. Evil characters may romance her, but they must be a little more careful than others.

- Getting all the answers right so that Imoen falls in love with her Bhaalspawn sibling is tricky. However, having a healthy relationship with your sister isn't all that hard. There is quite a bit of content in the mod that has nothing to do with romance and may be enjoyed by any PC.

- There is some mild bad language sprinkled here and there.

- Things get rather steamy when spending quality time with Imoen.

- A wide variety of dialogue choices was one of the priorities when writing this mod. Some of these options are a little crazy, some of these options are cruel, and some are flat out depraved.

- Don't just wait for Imoen to start talking to you. Sometimes you have to initiate the conversation; to do this, click the "talk to" icon down there by the weapons, and click on Imoen.

- The music is homemade with terribly primitive instruments. Do forgive if you don't like, and just appreciate the thought!

4.	*** VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ***

Dreams are important. They tell us things that we can't figure out with our conscious minds. Rest often, it's good for you.

7.  V E R S I O N      N O T E S :

NEW: Eternal Imoen. Keep the same Imoen that you had in Irenicus Dungeon instead of getting a "new Imoen" afterwards (she'll get an EXP bonus to match your party). It's compatible with BGT's Eternal Imoen.



FIXED: "TOmer" typo in Imoen's script.

______

v1.012
______


FIXED: Phaere's Loops. And I'm serious. (You MUST thank Parmeni for this; without the savegame it would have been impossible for me to solve it.)

FIXED: Quality time loop.

FIXED: DeArnise comment crash.

INCLUDED: If you drop your current romance with (insertpastloveinteresthereexceptsolaufein) at any point, you might be able to romance Imoen if you haven't lost the opportunity yet (That is, if you haven't come out of the Underdark.) <-- Thanks to Kaylord for the idea

FIXED: Jaheira and Viconia went jerking all of sudden if certain dialogue option was chosen (Thanks to Xanar of House Kiran and his 'in-depth' research on this)

*warning: you might not get the idea of what the next fix is about if you haven't participated in the small 'discussion' in the forums concerning this...* 
FIXED: Instead of when their romance globals are in 2, now the global "ImoenRomanceActive" is set to 4 when you choose certain dialogue options when in the lovetalks WITH THE BIOWARE ROMANCES (These options are those that imply that you are interested in a *loving* way with them: Aerie if you tell her "I love you" or "I care for you deeply"; Jaheira it's pretty evident since there's a new option to choose in that lovetalk; Viconia if you choose to sleep with her) 

FIXED: Little money-talk kind of bug

INCLUDED: "Flirt Packs" full compatibility. Install them after or before Imoen's romance, whatever you want.

FIXED: in previous versions, no matter who force-talked Imoen, she acted as if she was talking to the PC. Now it's not like that.

FIXED: 5th lovetalk dialogue-setting bug

______

v1.013
______


INCLUDED: Two brief dialogues that never made it into the previous releases: 'Fresh air Comment' and 'Illithid Cell Comment'.

ADDED: Around twenty or thirty lines of aditional party interjections for Imoen's dialogues. 

INCLUDED: Thanks to Bingham, a common sense adition: choosing one of those *extremely violent* options that are around there will imply some points of reputation lost and sometimes even an alignment change, depending on what exact act of brutality you perform. It has no sense a Lawful Good paladin chooses to beat Imoen's face to a bloody pulp and remain unpunished...

ADDED: Gong quest Imoen's interjections. Userunfriendly can be proud; it's thanks to him why they are here now.

ADDED: Imoen-Selfish quest in hell interaction.

FIXED: Bug after Bodhi-Imoen's 'abduction' scene; a little dialogue was being skipped.

FIXED: Alisha's morale break (it won't be fixed if you are already in the area with Alisha there... I hope you have a savegame from *before* you enter the area.)

FIXED: Ranger stronghold talk got stuck.

'Skatcarothe' has been improved (though if you already have it, you would have to get the item again if you want to make use of the improvements... the only way to do this, legally, is loading a game before the cut scene where she acquires it takes place)

Several proofreading; thanks to Bingham and Cybersquirt (the rest of it in the next patch)

______

v1.014
______


FIXED: Imoen will no longer say that Female Edwin has a beard... (Thanks to Userunfriendly for pointing it out)

FIXED: The gong interjections made Imoen leave (again, Userunfriendly is to be thanked for noticing this in the first place)

INCLUDED: Meet Kitthix... ... ... (Winks at Xanar of House Kiran)

INCLUDED: Some genderchecks and corrections so some dialogues will fit more to both genders. (Thanks to AG3)

FIXED: Imoen will no longer have force-talk options for herself (Ditto)

FIXED: Now Imoen won't say that Bodhi is "alive" and has her soul when you have killed her already. (DITTO!!)

FIXED: Stronghold bugs, and I think this is final...

FIXED: Countless spelling and grammar mistakes, and general improvement to the dialogues (Bows to Bingham and Xanar of house Kiran; more to come on the next patch)

Added a DropInventory() command in the involvement scene so you won't chase Imoen while wielding madly two Katanas or something like that. Just be sure you pick it all up later! (Xanar of House Kiran had this tremendously wise, realistic idea.)
PS: I wasn't able to test this last thing: if any of your inventory disappear (i.e. there are some items missing in the pile where your inventory and Imoen's was dropped) tell me and I'll remove at once -not without shame- this 'fix'.

______

v1.100
______

FIXED: Small teeth pass should no longer show up in the world map after third dream.

FIXED: Ellesime's dream should no longer be able to trigger in the involvement scene.

FIXED: Dream timers have been shortened. No one rests that much...

FIXED: Selfish problems

ADDED: Little dialogue for post-Selfish when it's Aerie who is taken

FIXED: Small typo in the meeting sequence that completely screwed up the romance.

FIXED: You will no longer be able to talk about your dreams with the party members once you reach chapter 4 (Brynn Law)

ADDED: Possibility of 1) Romancing Imoen when you have gone through all of the Aerie's romance (AerieRomanceActive = 2, SleptAerie = 1); this would ruin Aerie's romance, of course. And 2) Imoen and Aerie to be friends, if you romanced Aerie, but dumped her/slept with her, and later on you romanced Imoen. Extensive new dialogue concerning it.

FIXED: Installation no longer needs to replace AR0603.are, thus incompatibility risks have been reduced... another way of making the dialogue trigger was used. Invisible rabbits can be so useful...

FIXED: Kindness Counter requirement increased.

FIXED: Proofreading is finished. Bingham is to be thanked for more than half of it: his great suggestions on style, grammar, spelling and thesaurus have melted with my original texts, with a beautiful result, and with his help, the dialogues (mostly the quality times) have been spiced up a little (or a lot, depending on the case...)
Also, going through the re-reading of all the text, I made MANY modifications myself and added many new lines too, mainly to the first things that were ever written for the mod (like the main talks with Imoen, for exaple) but to the whole dialogues in general. I added some GREAT "easter eggs" too, heh...
Xanar was REALLY helpful with many strings that refused to obey my command, did some extremely useful proofreading and gave some pretty neat ideas too... *bows to Xanar*
I really think a whole new run-through through all the mod would be worth the effort, but it is only my opinion...

ADDED: A non-Imoen romance thing, just for fun. I've always been a little disappointed with the little glimpse of madness you can grant Desharik with; now, he will have TRUE reasons to think you are utterly, completely, undoubtedly and positively mad. So much that your alignment will change to Chaotic Neutral if you choose those newe options...

FIXED: Now, just before the "involvement scene", instead of waiting for Imoen to speak to you after she suggests to rest, you have to actually HIT the rest button for it to begin. You can postpone this all the time you want so long as you don't go to the graveyard district. Have in mind that it will only trigger in the elven encampment.
(It is the way it was meant to be in the first place. It's just that I hadn't found a way to do it... until now.)

FIXED: Other miscellaneous fixes that I can't even remember.

______

v1.101
______

FIXED: Aerie's script game-crashing bug.

FIXED: Several weird dialogue loops, the straight way. Still intrigued about why it happens. My thanks to Rei_Janus for the report that made me see this really weird behaviour.

FIXED: The "not getting to tell the dreams" thing. Thanks Stone Wolf for pointing it out.

______

v1.102
______


FIXED: Small typo that prevented the Ten Years dialogue option to appear. Thanks to Gerald.

FIXED: Some bad scripting about Aerie's interactions. Fixed thanks to AG3.

FIXED: Typo in string references, made one of Imoen's lines not to appear. Fixed thanks to AG3, again.

FIXED: And thanks to AG3 again the small dialogue adjustment with the money and the Spellhold talks is there.

FIXED: Certain "out-of-placeness" in the dialogues. Cybersquirt is a wise person.

FIXED: Dream timer slight error and rebalancing.

ADDED: Some more requirements for non-in-combat status.

FIXED: Romanced-Aerie-friendship small bug.

FIXED: Imoen says now an almost literal "take me somewhere green you dope" when force talked in *that* dialogue inside places with roof.

FIXED: Imoen talks repetition, detected by AG3

______

v1.103
______


FIXED: The mod should now install with Big Picture mod installed in your system.

FIXED: Minor bug in the scripts.

FIXED: Typos, redundant strings.

Changed compression format to .rar in an attempt to reduce the flow of "what-do-I-do-with-this-ace-thingie" type of e-mails...

______

v1.104
______


FIXED: Problem with the mini-talk in the illithid cell. Thanks to Xanar.

FIXED: Grammar and typos. No, really, an humongous quantity of them, hundreds of little refinements fixing grammar and typographical errors, and a few confusing lines too. Another great contribution from Xanar.

FIXED: Timers, tight packing. If you find two dialogues coming together, please report it, that *shouldn't* happen.

FIXED: The bracelet scene came up with a force-talking-instead-of-proper-dialogue thing! Hlidskialf was right on this, it should be fixed now, and again Xanar to be thanked.

_____

1.105
_____


FIXED: Stronghold talk - Ranger cabin now works well.

FIXED: Now the soul talk can't be had until you solve your problems with Imoen.

Tight packing methods have been used in this version to reduce the download size drastically (it's less than half its original size now)
This is thanks to TisPack, a very neat program developed by Per Olofsson and impulsed by Jason Compton. You all should make use of it, dammit!
And thanks to xm2wav program, developed by Digisnap. Don't know if that's a person or a company, heh... anyway it allows my beloved Fasttracker 2 files be converted to .wav without using the program itself.
Besides now, if you are one of those Fasttracker 2 weirdos that remain out there like me, you can look at the "source code" of the songs, hehe...

_______________________________

1.106 was lost in a time vortex
_______________________________
______

v1.107
______


FIXED: After the third Imoen-dream, the player would remain invisible. Now (s)he doesn't.

FIXED: Bug that didn't allow the post-underdark lovetalks to show up if you hadn't had all the talks with Imoen before the Underdark.

FIXED: Some little things in grammar and spelling. Removed several neologisms.

FIXED: A bug in two strings that were misplaced in The Talk.

FIXED: Wrong strings in the dream-talk with Imoen.         

Settled the damn elder / big BrotherSister thing.

Modified an option that allowed you to turn down Jaheira in a friendly way, to make it more gentle and less painful (not painful at all) for her.

Updated WeiDU version.

______

v1.108
______


FIXED: Tons of little tweaks done over time. I can't really remember any of them except the "we're in hell - let's shag" non-sequitur reported by Neuron, and also the "introducing companions to Imoen / soloing to spellhold" dialogue reported by Rei Janus.  You'll probably not notice the rest since they are little details.

ADDED: French translation done by Matt

______

v1.109
______


ADDED: Translation to Spanish, done by Clan REO. Many lines still have to be revised; if you have a suggestion to make the Spanish translation better, mail either me (Lord_Mirrabbo@hotmail.com) or Riojano2002 (Riojano2002@hotmail.com).
AÑADIDO: Traducción al español, hecha por el Clan REO. Muchas líneas aún han de ser revisadas; si tienes alguna sugerencia de cómo hacer la traducción a español mejor, mánda un correo a mi persona de mi (Lord_Mirrabbo@hotmail.com) o a Riojano2002 (Riojano2002@hotmail.com)
