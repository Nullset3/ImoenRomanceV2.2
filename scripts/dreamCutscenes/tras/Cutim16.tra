@0   = ~Imoen's words echo in your head as if she has just whispered them into your brain, telling you that you must rush to rescue her no matter the cost~
@1   = ~A third dream with Imoen.

This time the visions were filled with angst... by far, it was the most real dream of them all. I can still feel her cries of terror, her shudders and sobs. Somehow I have the certainty she's going through a horrible torture wherever she's being held.
She asked me to "help her", that she "couldn't stand it anymore". Whether she is truly communicating with me, or these are just random dreams about what I imagine she is suffering, I can't begin to guess. The only way to know is to ask her directly...~
