@0   = ~You wake up covered in sweat, and no matter what you do you can't get out of your mind that last kiss~
@1   = ~Another weird dream.

Imoen (or an image of her) showed up again last night, this time being much more explicit... these dreams have nothing to do with my taint at all. They are very different from the first three ones...
About what she shows me, I do remember vaguely that lake, but it all is blurry in my head. It is confusing, her words are clearly aimed to suggest that I am, or have been, in love with her. I had never had such dreams before. Perharps it is her abscence what makes me obsessed with her? Maybe she is comunicating with me somehow, wherever she is? I won't know until I reach her.~
