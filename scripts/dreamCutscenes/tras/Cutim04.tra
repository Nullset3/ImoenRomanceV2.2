@0   = ~You wake up with the kiss burning intensely both in your brain and lips, making you feel really weird about it. You can't help a shiver run up your spine.~
@1   = ~Imoen appeared in my dreams.


I had yet another dream with Imoen last night. This one though was different from the others... it wasn't related at all with the 'taint' but with our personal relationship.
I think "she" tried to tell me that there's more between us than our friendship. It felt incredibly real, like the others, especially in the final part... I don't know why this shows up all of sudden, maybe my ascendancy has something to do with it after all...
Why, that's something I don't know.~
